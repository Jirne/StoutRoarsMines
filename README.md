<h1 style="text-align: center;">Stoutroar's Mines</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;">
The great king Thorrigg Stoutroar got into his head to get back the mines of his stronghold which were abandonned due to the last outburst of <b>Dragon-Rage</b> - A disease able to drive most of the dwarfs several miles around crazy, killing each other - centuries ago.
<br />
Wealth and Glory are promised by the mine to the most daring dwarfs willing to explore them and facing its dangers.
